 * correct and support MIPS machine instructions (one per line).  If
 * the file is not a valid input file, an error message is printed and
 * the program exits.  If the input file is valid, the instructions from 
 * the file are simulated on an ideal pipeline, a stalling pipeline, and a 
 * data forwarding pipeline, with information printed about the relevant
 * dependences that might cause stalling as well, when each instruction
 * completes, and the overall execution time for each pipeline.
